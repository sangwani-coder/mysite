	    <p>
            Hello! I'm Peter Zyambo, a passionate software engineer, martial arts enthusiast, and a dedicated music teacher.<br> 
            With over 5 years of experience, I've honed my skills as a full stack developer while specializing in <br>
            backend engineering, creating seamless digital experiences and robust systems.<br>
            
            My journey as a software engineer has allowed me to combine my love for problem-solving and creativity. <br>
            I thrive on turning ideas into functional and elegant solutions, leveraging the power of technology to bring <br>
            visions to life.
            
            Beyond coding, I find balance through martial arts, where I've been coaching for more than 10 years. <br>
            Martial arts teach discipline, perseverance, and the art of continuous improvementâ€”values that resonate 
            both in my coding and teaching.<br>
            
            Music also holds a special place in my heart. I'm not only a passionate pianist, guitarist, and trumpeter but
            also a music instructor. <br> Teaching music allows me to share the joy of creative expression with others.
            
            In my free time, you'll find me with a good book in hand, diving into various subjects to expand my horizons.<br>
            I believe that continuous learning is at the core of personal and professional growth.
            
            As a freelance developer, I'm committed to turning your software dreams into reality. Whether it's crafting <br>
            user-friendly apps for web , mobile and desktop or building robust backend systems, I'm here to make your digital <br>
            vision a success.
            
            Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to collaborating with you on your next exciting project.
