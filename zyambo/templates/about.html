                    Hello! I'm Peter Zyambo, a passionate software engineer, martial arts enthusiast, and a dedicated
                    music teacher. My journey as a software engineer has allowed me to combine my love for
                    problem-solving
                    and creativity. <br><br> I thrive on turning ideas into functional and elegant solutions, leveraging
                    the power of
                    technology to bring visions to life.

                    Beyond coding, I find balance through martial arts, where I've been coaching for more than 10 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Martial arts teach discipline, perseverance, and the art of continuous improvementâ€”values that
                    resonate both in my coding and teaching.<br> Music also holds a special place in my heart. I'm not
                    only a
                    passionate pianist, guitarist, and trumpeter but also a music instructor. Teaching music allows me
                    to
                    share the joy of creative expression with others.<br><br>

                    In my free time, you'll find me with a good book in hand, diving into various subjects to expand my
                    horizons. I believe that continuous learning is at the core of personal and professional
                    growth.<br><br>
