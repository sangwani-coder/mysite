        <p>
            Hello! I'm Peter Zyambo, a passionate software engineer, martial arts enthusiast, and a dedicated music
            teacher.<br> My journey as a software engineer has allowed me to combine my love for problem-solving and
            creativity.
            <br> I thrive on turning ideas into functional and elegant solutions, leveraging the power of technology to
            bring
            visions to life.
        </p>

        </p>
        Beyond coding, I find balance through martial arts, where I've been coaching for more than 10 years. <br>
        Martial arts teach discipline, perseverance, and the art of continuous improvementâ€”values that resonate
        both in my coding and teaching.<br> Music also holds a special place in my heart. I'm not only a passionate
        pianist, guitarist, and trumpeter but also a music instructor. <br> Teaching music allows me to share the
        joy of creative expression with others.<br>
        <p>
        <p>
            In my free time, you'll find me with a good book in hand, diving into various subjects to expand my
            horizons.<br> I believe that continuous learning is at the core of personal and professional growth.<br>
